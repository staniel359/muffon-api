I had sent the album off to mastering, but the song didn't sit right with me and I decided, at the last possible moment, to leave it off the album. It's intentionally a very bittersweet sounding song. I asked Ben Talmi who did the string arrangements on ‘Shadow’ to help out with this very simple dissonant string part I was hearing in my head which is now my favorite element in the track. It's a song about walking through to the other side of crippling self-doubt with the help of someone you love. It's a reminder to myself not to let things spiral, hard as it may be at times.”"}}
