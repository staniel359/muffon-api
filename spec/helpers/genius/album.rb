          {:album=>{:description=>"Big Beat is the sixth album by American rock band Sparks, released in 1976.\n\nBig Beat was recorded at Mediasound Studios, New York City in August 1976. The album was the group’s first album after breaking away from their English backing band. Instead, the Mael Brothers used session musicians and hired former Milk ‘N’ Cookies bassist, and Roxy Music contributor (Viva!), Sal Maida on bass, Tuff Darts guitarist Jeffrey Salen and Hilly Boy Michaels on drums. The release was their first for Columbia Records in the US. The album employed a much heavier and harder rock sound. Initially, the Mael brothers had returned to work with the early Sparks member Earle Mankey. Together, they recorded the song “England”, a song which bore much in common with the jaunty home-made and unusual sound that the three musicians had made together in the early 1970s. Conversely, Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser’s production on the album was slicker and more direct and the resulting album displayed a more “American” AOR sound. This new “West Coast” sound was deemed a failure as Sparks felt the results were “bereft of personality”."}}
